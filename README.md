# DeepLearning-car-parts
Project about recognizing pictures of car parts using as little data as possible.

Machine learning with neural networks usually starts with gathering large amount of data so you can get the best result. 
That however is not always possible, since many problems that occur in the real world have very limited amount of data 
and to solve them you have to rely on only the data at hand. But there are some ways to address this problem and make 
small amount of data work as if there is more.

In this project we will try to study and distinguish how small amount of data can work in a deep learning environment. 
We will test out how well it works to use a pre-trained network and data augmentation. Compare two different networks, 
one that it pre-trained on the imagent image database and one that is not.
